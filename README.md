# ITEC FINALS: STATIC WEBSITE
- This is my finals for my course in ITEC.
- I used **html and css and vanilla** js for this project 

# RESOURSES 
Here are the resources i used to make this site:
- [Svg Waves.io](https://svgwave.in/) to make those cool looking waves
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons
- [Nice Page](https://nicepage.com/css-templates) to be "inspired" for making content on the page

#SPECIAL THANKS
I would like to thank two of my friends for helping me suggest and add new functions in my project
